I want
each cycle as a line
rather
then within each line, read 1 and read 2 separated by a '|'
All of the qscores [2-40] separated by ','
and within those, the base calls (0,1,2,3) joined by ':'
Oh, and I'd like it to be human-readable integers, not offset by 33.
I'll do the offset and char conversion in the parsing
array_parser.h is the code.
