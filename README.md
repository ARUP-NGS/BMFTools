UnexpectedProtocols
===================

Random segments of code that have grouped together to form unexpected protocols.

Choose wisely, ye who partake of these offerings.*


*In other words, this is a bunch of fragments of code which I've found useful and might tweak up in the future.
It's good to have it backed up and it may be invaluable to have version control.
